# 🔐 Full-Stack Authentication System with Next.js & TypeScript

A modern, secure, and responsive full-stack authentication system built using **Next.js (App Router + TypeScript)**. Designed with a **Cyberpunk-inspired UI**, this project includes essential auth features like login, signup, email verification, password reset, JWT-based security, and protected routes.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project was initially inspired by a course from **[@HiteshChoudhary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiteshchoudharyofficial/)**, which helped me understand the fundamentals of authentication systems. I then extended it by:

● Rewriting and optimizing core logic for **real-world use cases**  
● Adding advanced features like **email verification**, **token-based password reset**, and **route protection**  
● Designing a **custom UI** from scratch with a **Cyberpunk theme**  
● Gaining hands-on experience with **Next.js API routes**, **middleware**, and **full-stack TypeScript integration**
